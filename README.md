# Hi everyone!👋
#### 📝About Me: 
🔭 Hi, I'm Nikhil, an aspiring data analyst with a long-term goal of becoming a data scientist.

👀 I'm passionate about working with data to uncover insights and decision-making. 

💻 I recently completed a Post Graduate Diploma in Big Data Analytics (PG-DBDA) from CDAC, where I gained experience in data wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and visualization using tools like Excel, Python(Pandas, NumPy,Matplotlib,Seaborn), SQL, PowerBI.

🌱 I'm currently learning machine learning and predictive modeling, and I'm always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and skill set.
